					<div class="col-sm-12">
							<p>Hello. I am Luis Diego Gonz&aacute;lez-Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga, commonly known as <em>diekus</em>. I am a computer engineer graduated in 2008 from the <a href="http://www.tec.ac.cr">Costa Rican Institute of Technology</a>. I underwent a master’s degree in Information Systems there as well. Nowadays I returned to a student’s life in 2010 with a master’s degree in Multimedia Technologies following with a PhD program in AmI at the <a href="http://www.uab.cat">Autonomous University of Barcelona</a> - I also collaborate with <a href="http://www.rave.ac.uk">Ravensbourne College</a> in London as a Research Associate.</p>
										<p>In the past I’ve developed myself in the private and public sector. I firmly believe in the successful combination of both sectors in order to drive innovation and knowledge to the industry and the other way around resources and opportunities to the academia. I have worked with big companies such as <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/costarica">Microsoft Corporation</a>, <a href="http://www.chiquita.com">Chiquita Brands International</a> and <a href="http://www.dole.com">Dole Food Company</a>. I have also worked in big local software consultancy companies as <a href="http://www.dcicr.com">Dinámica Consultores</a>. I have learned a lot in those places and keep many good memories of them, but my interest in areas other than line of business applications, business intelligence and databases has made me move on to the academia also, where I had to handle around 190 young minds from diverse areas of engineering – it has been one of the most thrilling work experiences in my life, and I hope I can return part time to the academia and do research on things that I am really passionate about.</p>
										<p> One's areas of interest vary through time. It seems like yesterday when I, as every computer science student, wanted to be a video game developer or glorified web master. Technology, as our mind, never stops evolving. Currently my main areas of interest are related to stereoscopy, mediatecture, multimedia, mobile technologies, human computer interaction and natural user interfaces. I try to read and keep up to date on the subject, as well as work in related fields, a task not always easy to find, nonetheless, exciting when done.</p>
										<p>When I am not studying, I enjoy backpacking, learning about other cultures and going out. I am part of a group that builds human towers, the <a href="http://cvg.cat">Castellers de la Vila de Gr&agrave;cia.</a> I also enjoy taking photographs of things that I visualize as part of a composition for media projects, most of them which just stay in my mind. I have a week spot for <a href="http://user.gdgt.com/diekus/">gadgets</a> and consider myself to be very well informed of the gadget-culture and of course, a proud owner of some of the best pieces of consumer-oriented electronic artifacts available in the market today.</p>
										<p>I am currently based in Barcelona, although studies and vacations constantly make me a hard person to track, be it London (which is pretty much my second home), Istanbul, Tel Aviv or more tropical destinations like Costa Rica, I'm probably always closer than you might expect.</p>
										<p>Cheers! </p>
